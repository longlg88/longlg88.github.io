title: "MicroK8S Install & Run"

MicroK8S is made in CNCF. Ubuntu provided this platform and I'm a heavy user about Ubuntu. 

You should check these sites.
`https://microk8s.io/`
`https://github.com/ubuntu/microk8s`



### Before Install
You need these.
* Spec:
	- VirtualBox
	- Ubuntu 18.04

### Install
First, you need to know whether the virtual machine is installed Ubuntu. If it is not, you should install Ubuntu. I installed Version of 18.04.

*__Soon, I will review MicroK8S in MacOS.__*

** Install **
```bash
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt-get -y upgrade
$ sudo snap install microk8s --classic
```

Then, Check status for microk8s
```bash
$ sudo microk8s.status
microk8s is not running. Use microk8s.inspect for a deeper inspection.
```

It doesn't start... So, we start the microk8s now.
```bash
$ sudo microk8s.start
Started.
Enabling pod scheduling
node/xxx already uncordoned
```

That's it!!! And then, check status for microk8s
```bash
$ sudo microk8s.status
microk8s is running
addons:
knative: disabled
jaeger: disabled
fluentd: disabled
gpu: disabled
storage: disabled
registry: disabled
rbac: disabled
ingress: disabled
dns: disabled
metrics-server: disabled
linkerd: disabled
prometheus: disabled
istio: disabled
dashboard: disabled
```

I think it is all done. But one more check this command. 'microk8s.inspect'
```bash
# sudo microk8s.inspect
Inspecting services
  Service snap.microk8s.daemon-containerd is running
  Service snap.microk8s.daemon-apiserver is running
  Service snap.microk8s.daemon-proxy is running
  Service snap.microk8s.daemon-kubelet is running
  Service snap.microk8s.daemon-scheduler is running
  Service snap.microk8s.daemon-controller-manager is running
  Service snap.microk8s.daemon-etcd is running
  Copy service arguments to the final report tarball
Inspecting AppArmor configuration
Gathering system info
  Copy network configuration to the final report tarball
  Copy processes list to the final report tarball
  Copy snap list to the final report tarball
  Inspect kubernetes cluster










Building the report tarball
  Report tarball is at /var/snap/microk8s/671/inspection-report-20190722_160306.tar.gz
```

Good!!
You can enable or disable addons.
We should enable dns
```bash
$ sudo microk8s.enable dns
Enabling DNS
Applying manifest
serviceaccount/coredns created
configmap/coredns created
deployment.apps/coredns created
service/kube-dns created
Restarting kubelet
DNS is enabled
```

### Setting VirtualBox for port-forwarding
We use VirtualBox and if we use kubernetes, it needs to be set for port-forwarding.

    /images/port-forwarding.png
{% endcapture %}
{% include gallery images=images caption="Port-forwarding for VirtualBox" col=3 %}

### Setting Dahsboard
Use Dashboard
```bash
$ sudo microk8s.enable dashboard
Applying manifest
secret/kubernetes-dashboard-certs created
serviceaccount/kubernetes-dashboard created
role.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/kubernetes-dashboard-minimal created
rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/kubernetes-dashboard-minimal created
deployment.apps/kubernetes-dashboard created
service/kubernetes-dashboard created
service/monitoring-grafana created
service/monitoring-influxdb created
service/heapster created
deployment.extensions/monitoring-influxdb-grafana-v4 created
serviceaccount/heapster created
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/heapster created
configmap/heapster-config created
configmap/eventer-config created
deployment.extensions/heapster-v1.5.2 created

If RBAC is not enabled access the dashboard using the default token retrieved with:

token=$(microk8s.kubectl -n kube-system get secret | grep default-token | cut -d " " -f1)
microk8s.kubectl -n kube-system describe secret $token

In an RBAC enabled setup (microk8s.enable RBAC) you need to create a user with restricted
permissions as shown in https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/wiki/Creating-sample-user
```

Alias microk8s.kubectl command to 'k'
```bash
$ sudo vi .bashrc
...
alias k='microk8s.kubectl

$ source .bashrc
```


Run kube-proxy
``` bash
$ k proxy --address=10.0.2.15
Starting to serve on 10.0.2.15:8001
```

IP `10.0.2.15` is VirtualBox's IP.
We enter kubernetes dashboard's address, then it sees VirtualBox's IP and Port 8000. We set Port 8000 on previous setting.
It goes through 8000 to 8001 by port-forwarding. Port 8001 is kube-proxy's port, so it could be call Kuberentes API.

### Connect Dashboard
You should try to connect kubernetes-dashboard in Explorer or Chrome
`http://localhost:8000/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/https:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/`


### Connect Grafana
You should try to connect grafana in Explorer or Chrome
`http://localhost:8000/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/monitoring-grafana/proxy/`
