MicroK8S is made in CNCF. Ubuntu provided this platform and I'm a heavy user about Ubuntu. So, Try this one.

### Before Install
You need these.
* Spec:
	- VirtualBox
	- Ubuntu 18.04

### Install
First, you need to know whether the virtual machine is installed Ubuntu. If it is not, you should install Ubuntu. I installed Version of 18.04.
*Soon, I will review MicroK8S in MacOS.*

** Install **
```bash
# sudo apt update
# sudo apt-get -y upgrade
# sudo snap install microk8s --classic
```

Then, Check status for microk8s
```bash
# sudo microk8s.status
microk8s is not running. Use microk8s.inspect for a deeper inspection.
```

It doesn't start... So, we start the microk8s now.
```bash
# sudo microk8s.start
Started.
Enabling pod scheduling
node/xxx already uncordoned
```

That's it!!! And then, check status for microk8s
```bash
# sudo microk8s.status
microk8s is running
addons:
knative: disabled
jaeger: disabled
fluentd: disabled
gpu: disabled

rbac: disabled

metrics-server: disabled

prometheus: disabled

I think it is all done. But one more check this command. 'microk8s.inspect'
```bash
# sudo microk8s.inspect

  Service snap.microk8s.daemon-containerd is running
