MicroK8S is made in CNCF. Ubuntu provided this platform and I'm a heavy user about Ubuntu. So, Try this one.

### Before Install
You need these.
* Spec:
	- VirtualBox
	- Ubuntu 18.04

### Install
First, you need to know whether the virtual machine is installed Ubuntu. If it is not, you should install Ubuntu. I installed Version of 18.04.
*Soon, I will review MicroK8S in MacOS.*

** Install **
```bash
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt-get -y upgrade
$ sudo snap install microk8s --classic
```

Then, Check status for microk8s
```bash
$ sudo microk8s.status
microk8s is not running. Use microk8s.inspect for a deeper inspection.
```

It doesn't start... So, we start the microk8s now.
```bash
$ sudo microk8s.start
Started.
Enabling pod scheduling
node/xxx already uncordoned
```

That's it!!! And then, check status for microk8s
```bash
$ sudo microk8s.status
microk8s is running
addons:
knative: disabled
jaeger: disabled
fluentd: disabled
gpu: disabled
storage: disabled
registry: disabled
rbac: disabled
ingress: disabled
dns: disabled
metrics-server: disabled
linkerd: disabled
prometheus: disabled
istio: disabled
dashboard: disabled
```

I think it is all done. But one more check this command. 'microk8s.inspect'
```bash
# sudo microk8s.inspect
Inspecting services
  Service snap.microk8s.daemon-containerd is running
  Service snap.microk8s.daemon-apiserver is running

  Service snap.microk8s.daemon-kubelet is running
  Service snap.microk8s.daemon-scheduler is running
  Service snap.microk8s.daemon-controller-manager is running

  Copy processes list to the final report tarball
  Copy snap list to the final report tarball
  Inspect kubernetes cluster










Building the report tarball
  Report tarball is at /var/snap/microk8s/671/inspection-report-20190722_160306.tar.gz
```

Good!!
You can enable or disable addons.
We should enable dns
```bash
$ sudo microk8s.enable dns
Enabling DNS
Applying manifest
serviceaccount/coredns created
configmap/coredns created
deployment.apps/coredns created
service/kube-dns created
Restarting kubelet
DNS is enabled
```

### Setting Dahsboard
Use Dashboard
```bash
$ sudo microk8s.enable dashboard
Applying manifest
secret/kubernetes-dashboard-certs created
serviceaccount/kubernetes-dashboard created
role.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/kubernetes-dashboard-minimal created
rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/kubernetes-dashboard-minimal created
deployment.apps/kubernetes-dashboard created
service/kubernetes-dashboard created
service/monitoring-grafana created
service/monitoring-influxdb created
service/heapster created
deployment.extensions/monitoring-influxdb-grafana-v4 created
serviceaccount/heapster created
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/heapster created
configmap/heapster-config created
configmap/eventer-config created
deployment.extensions/heapster-v1.5.2 created

If RBAC is not enabled access the dashboard using the default token retrieved with:

token=$(microk8s.kubectl -n kube-system get secret | grep default-token | cut -d " " -f1)
microk8s.kubectl -n kube-system describe secret $token

In an RBAC enabled setup (microk8s.enable RBAC) you need to create a user with restricted
permissions as shown in https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/wiki/Creating-sample-user
```

Alias microk8s.kubectl command to 'k'
```bash
$ sudo vi .bashrc
...
alias k='microk8s.kubectl

$ source .bashrc
```


Check dashboard service cluster IP.
``` bash
$ k get svc/kubernetes-dashboard -n kube-system
```
